                Here's a time line of that fateful night:
            </h3>
            <div id="bullets">
                <ul>
                    <li>Sergeant Benavidez learns his friend Leroy Wright, who had recently saved Benavidez' life,  was part of a stranded special forces team under heavy fire.</li>
                    <li> He grabs a bag of medical supplies and instinctively volunters to board a helicopter for another rescue attempt.</li>
                    <li>Realizing that all the team members were either dead or wounded and unable to move to the pickup zone, he directed the aircraft to a nearby clearing while he jumped from the hovering helicopter, and ran approximately 75 meters under withering small-arms fire to the crippled team.</li>
                    <li>Prior to reaching the team's position he was wounded in his right leg, face, and head.</li>
                    <li>Sgt Benavidez then directed a new extraction attempt and dragged half of the wounded team to the aircraft under enemy fire.</li>
                    <li>Next he returned to successfully reclaim classified documents from the dead team leader and was wounded by a bullet to his abdomen and grenade fragments to his back.</li>
                    <li>At nearly the same time the pilot of the rescue craft was killed and the rescue helo crashed.</li>
                    <li>Sgt Benavidez once again resuced the wounded from the overturned aircraft and organized a defensive perimeter distributing water and ammunition.</li>
                    <li>He was wounded again in his thigh while administering first aid to others and calling in air support to protect his team for the next 6 hours.</li>
                    <li>While ferrring his comrades to the latest rescue helicopter, he was clubbed in his head and arms before killing his adversary.</li>
                    <li>Upon reaching the aircraft, he killed two enemy soliders who had snuck up behind the aircraft, thereby saving yet another rescue attemp.</li>
                    <li>Only after securing all documentation and wounded did he allow himself to be pulled into the extraction aircraft.</li>
                </ul>
