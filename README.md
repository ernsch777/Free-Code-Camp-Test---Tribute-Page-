1. I am going to upload all of my Free Code Camp online tests to Git and this is the first one. Super simple tribute page with some text, an image, a link, and some basic styling. It's not a page that I would put online myself but I am going to stick pretty close to their tests for their course's completeness sake. 
2. Had some issues centering my text so I need to clear up the best ways to center when using divs, text, ul's, flex, and grid.
